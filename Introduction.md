# Introduction
Tells us without discipline, we will be paying more to clean the "mess"
## Design vs Architecture
Design = Architecture

More effort in the project down the road = bad design

Part of our developer's brain indeed sleeps despite we are working hard. That is, we ignore the benefits of clean and well designed code.

We fall over-confident to stay productive.

## Making mess is always slower than keeping clean

## Over-confidence during refactor will lead us into the mess again
