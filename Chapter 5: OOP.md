# 3 magic keywords of OOP

# Encapsulation
Once in C, it is perfect as the header file never export the internal structure of a class.
The use of private/public/protected is a hack. C# and java never separate header and code.

In fact, OOP languages are weakening encapsulation due to the compiler needs to know sizes.

# Inheritance
OOP is doing OK as it makes it easier, we could use some tricks to get C working like this.
But only easy for single inheritance. Also, OOP inheritance makes things easier.

# Polymorphism
Nothing new but safer and more convenient

# Dependency inversion
By default, the flow of logic determines the dependency of code. However, such thing
can be inverted by introducing interface class/API that interfaces both sides thus
the high level code decouples from underlying low level implementations.

# Power
The core idea of OOP is to give ability to control source file dependencies.
