# A story of Dijkstra
## Borrowed from math
Use of proof-like to maintain less "working set" of human brain
## Good vs Bad goto
Never recursively, iteratively goto is ok, if/else and for/while is controlled "structured" goto
## Decomposition and hierarchy
Since we cannot goto different scopes of the code, we can decompose the big question into small problem and tackle them
down individually.
# Math vs Science
programming is not math, and we are science, we have tests to have certain confidence of correctness of a program.
But never truly 100%, a goto program cannot be functionally decomposed thus not be able to test. Test meets the 
definition fo science of falsifiability.
