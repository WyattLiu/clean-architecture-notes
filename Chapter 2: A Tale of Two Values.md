# Behavior and Structure
# Scope vs Shape
The code should be "soft", that is changing the behavior should be linear with the scope of the change.

# Urgent vs Importance
Usually urgent matters are not important and vice versa. Making code works is urgent but less important, important thing
is the make sure the code is clean.
