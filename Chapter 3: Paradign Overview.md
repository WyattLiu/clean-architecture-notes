# Structured programming, OOP and Functional Programming

## structured programming omits direct code flow control
Meaning we never use goto, instead we use if/else if, for/while structures

## OOP introduces function pointers discipline
## Functional programming introduces discipline of assignment

# The only 3 paradigm we will ever have
Each time, it takes away something, we practically have nothing to give up.
